File Transformer is a comprehensive software solution designed to address the challenges of data conversion and security in modern information systems. The project focuses on developing a robust tool capable of converting text files into JSON format and vice-versa, while incorporating essential security measures to protect sensitive information.

**Core Features:**

1.  **Text-to-JSON Conversion:** The software enables the seamless transformation of structured text files, where data is separated by delimiters, into the widely used JSON format. This facilitates data interchange and integration with various applications and systems.
2.  **JSON-to-Text Conversion:** It also provides the reverse functionality, allowing users to convert JSON data back into text files with specified delimiters. This feature is valuable for exporting data or adapting it to systems that require text-based input.
3.  **Credit Card Encryption:** Recognizing the importance of data security, the project incorporates encryption mechanisms to safeguard sensitive credit card information within the JSON data. This ensures that confidential financial details are protected during storage and transmission.
4.  **Geographic Data Handling:** The software demonstrates its versatility by accommodating geographic data. It can either adhere to established OGC standards like GeoJSON or utilize custom coordinate array formats defined by the development team. This flexibility caters to diverse geospatial data requirements.
5.  **API-Driven Backend:** To optimize performance and maintainability, the core conversion and encryption processes are handled by a dedicated backend service. This service, accessible through APIs, performs the computationally intensive tasks, ensuring a responsive user interface.
6.  **User-Friendly Interface:** The project prioritizes user experience by providing an intuitive graphical interface. Users can easily select input and output file paths, specify delimiters, and manage encryption keys through a well-designed frontend.

**Project Goals:**

The primary objectives of the File Transformer project are:

-   **Data Interoperability:** Enhance data interoperability by facilitating the exchange of information between different file formats and systems.
-   **Data Security:** Prioritize data security by implementing encryption measures to protect sensitive information, particularly credit card data.
-   **Flexibility:** Offer flexibility in handling geographic data by supporting both standard and custom formats.
-   **Usability:** Provide a user-friendly interface that simplifies the conversion process and empowers users to manage data effectively.

By achieving these goals, File Transformer aims to be a valuable asset for individuals and organizations seeking a reliable and secure solution for data conversion and management.
